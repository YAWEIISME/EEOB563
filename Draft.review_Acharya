I do not think you need to mention all the things in your title. Just the title of the experiment should be enough. I have done the same. :)
Try to separate the headings from the paragraph using bold letters. It would make things cleaner. 
I think some part of your paper is not double spaced. If you do that, your paper would be even bigger. 
You need to mention where you got your data and the size of your data. 
The headings for the figures are not with the figure. I would suggest you to put the heading/description of the figure and the figure inside a textbox- that way they move together when you are editing.
You can include the research questions inside the introduction instead of creating a separate heading. I would also suggest you to add some more information in the introduction. 
I am confused about the outgroup. I think you need to assign a certain group as outgroup and than construct the tree. 
Make headings for results and discussions, and also for conclusion. 
All in all very interesting topic. Keep up the good work. :)
